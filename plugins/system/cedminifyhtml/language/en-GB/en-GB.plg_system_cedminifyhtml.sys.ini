PLG_SYSTEM_CEDMINIFYHTML_XML_DESCRIPTION="CedMinifyHTml minify the HTML generated code of your website. Compacting HTML code, including any inline JavaScript and CSS contained in it, can save many bytes of data and speed up download and parse times. Minification refers to the process of removing unnecessary or redundant data without affecting how the resource is processed by the browser - e.g. code comments and formatting, removing unused code, using shorter variable and function names, and so on."
